MOVIES RECOMMENDER PRO

1.	Problem Domain:
 	Problems: -  
1.	Large number of unsorted movies are available online.
2.	Viewer is unable to find the movies that he/she wants to watch.
3.	Movies are not available on the basis of mood/emotion of the user.
4.	 Existing software doesn’t suggest movies to improve viewer’s mood.

2.	Solution Domain:
 	Suggested Solutions: -
1.	We are making a software that is based on the present mood of the user.
2.	This software will give movie suggestion to the viewer according to their present mood.
3.	This software will suggest them latest and trending movies on their mood from a large variety of movies online by “Web Scraping”.

 	Purpose of the project: -
1.	The main purpose of the software is to suggest a list of movies to the viewer, from the large amount of content available online, based on his/her emotion.
2.	 Another purpose is to suggest list of latest and trending movies.



3. An improvement over the existing system: -
1.	We are suggesting movies based on ‘Human Emotion’ or their present mood, which is not present in the existing system.
2.	Rather than storing movies on database we are using “Web Scraping” to suggest latest featured films using internet.

3.	 System Domain:
 	Required Resources: -
1.	Software Requirements: -
	Windows (7, 8.1, 10)
	Python 3.7
	Sublime text 3
	PyCharm (Jet Brains)
2.	Hardware Requirements: -
	Processor - Intel (i3, i5, etc.)
	Hard Disk – 5 GB
	RAM – 1 GB
3.	Other Requirements: -
	Proper Internet connection (3G, 4G)

 	Methodology to be adopted / Planning of Work: -
1.	Here, we are using “Web Scraping”, to extract the data of movies from different websites like IMDB, and using it in our software.
2.	Web Scraping: - It is a technique to extract extra-large amount of data from the websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database.




3.	Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete.
4.	Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.




5.	Hence, this software will take your emotion as an input, every emotion is assigned to a genre, this genre is decided in accordance to improve your mood.
6.	In this software every emotion is linked with the “URL” of a website in accordance of your input.
7.	From that website by using python packages of web scraping like- Beautifulsoup4(bs4), lxml, requests etc. It will extract the data i.e. list of movies.
8.	Now with the help of our code the list will be printed as a desired output on your screen.



4.	Application Domain:
 	Scope of the project: -
1.	The reach this software is very vast, it is very useful for everyone, who likes to watch movies.
2.	Since every person of any age group likes to watch movies, hence this software is very useful for all those.

 	Impact of the work in real world: -
1.	Since movies are not available on the basis of mood/emotion of the user, this software provides easy and convenient way to search and suggest movies according to their mood.
2.	Suggested movies are always latest and trending.


 	Expected Outcomes/ Benefits: -
1.	Outcome: -
“List of latest featured movies based on the user’s input i.e. mood of user/emotion.”
